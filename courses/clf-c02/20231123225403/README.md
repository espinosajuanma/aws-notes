The issues with traditional IT approach by the instructor:

- Pay for the rent for the data center
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
- Deal disasters like power shutdown, fires, etc

### Thoughts

- Means only if you own and host fully the server machine and staff
