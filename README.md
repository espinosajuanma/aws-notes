# AWS Notes

I've been working with AWS since December, 2021. I want to keep improving my skills, and maybe prepare for a certification.

This repository is intended for my notes which probably are not going to be suited for you, since they are tailored for me and my learning process using AWS since over two years.

## Services I used until now

- IAM
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Connect
- AWS Lex
- DynamoDB
- CloudWatch
- SNS
- SES
